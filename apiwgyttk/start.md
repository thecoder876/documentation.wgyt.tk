_How to get started with Wgyt API_
## Get a token.
_If you use a token provided here, you will be rate limited more than if you get a token from Wgyt_
### Free tokens!
You can use the tokens `000000000000000000` or `testtesttesttestte`
## Get a token.
Join Wgyt's discord server and get the website role in #roles.
After that go to #get-api and mention @william when asking for an API token.

## Test out the token!
Go to https://api.wgyt.tk/about?token=[yourtoken]&username=[ausername] replacing [yourtoken] with your token and [ausername] with anything.

You should get a response of: `{"path":"/about","token":[yourtoken],"user":[ausername],"Body":"Hi there!"}` with [yourtoken] and [ausername] being what you provided earlier.
